Intro To Manufacturing (Lab)
This class was all about learning the manufacturing environment and becoming comfortable with it. We had 3 projects throughout the semester to help us do just that.

- The Clock Project: 
The most important part about the clock project is exactly what everyone tells you, start early. It takes time to not only machine the parts, but also to learn and familairize yourself with the controls of the mill and lathe. If I were to give one piece of advice to another student I would tell them to be deliberate with each action and not to make any irreversable mistakes. By making the most out each each mistake and learning exactly how to do better, getting a very precise part is very doable.

- The Coaster Project:
The goal of the coaster project was to learn the CNC mill. It is a very useful machine and can make part manufacturing quite simple. This project required us to study the anatomy of the CNC machine along with some other common manufacturing knowledge, like material and tool identification. My advice to a student preparing foir this would be to make sure you feel comfortable with the machine and to ask a friend to help you learn.

- The Screw Driver Project: 
The key to this project is patience. The knurling process is a lot of back and forth while double checking the set up to be sure it will end up knurling correctly. The drop forge and heat treatments, although intimidating, are not the most of your worry. The grinding process can be very teadious and it is important not to get frusterated.
